# React TS Styled Components Quickstarter

🤔  Do you often use create-react-app combined with styled-components for your React web apps? 

[**nod here**] 

Cool, me too! 🚀  And I find that I tend to set up my projects using the same structure over and over again. 

 So I've created this quickstarter repo following that same structure for a quick and easy clone!

## Structure
After installing a fresh copy of create-react-app, the following was added:

- Files for your colours & breakpoints! 📱 💻
- A `ThemeProvider` to wrap around your app using the above styles 🎨
- Some global styles using `createGlobalStyle` 🌍
- A __\__tests____ directory for your tests  ✅

That's it! 

I find working with this structure super useful. And who doesn't love saving a few minutes of repo setup? 😎

Enjoy!
